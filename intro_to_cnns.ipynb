Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"fully-connectedness\" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization include adding some form of magnitude measurement of weights to the loss function. However, CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns.\"\n",

    "The two distinctive types of layer inside of a typical CNN (and there may be several of each in a single network) are **convolutional** and **pooling** layers. Let's look at each in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Convolutional Layer is like a filter <br> John Newcomb asked \"so is it detecting color gradients ? depth gradients ?\" Norm said \"Yes\" <br> Brooke asked \"How is it possible to multiply a 3x3 matrix by a 2x2? I thought the number of columns in the first matrix had to match the number of rows in the second matrix\" Andrew answered \"the 2x2 filter passes over the 3x3 matrix. It's not quite standard matrix multiplication\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution\n",
    "Convolutional nets employ [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), which are a certain kind of transformation. In the context of neural networks processing images, this can be thought of as sliding a filter (of weights) over the image matrix to produce a new matrix of values. (We'll detail the calculation below.) The relative smallness of the filter means both that there will be relatively few parameters to learn and that the values representing certain areas of the image will be affected only by the values of *nearby areas*. This helps the network in **feature detection**. Let's check out some visualizations [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intuitive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-260c2de0a050/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Utkarsh Sinha shows us some examples of different kinds of filters [here](http://aishack.in/tutorials/convolutions/).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a & b & c \\\\\n",
    "d & e & g \\\\\n",
    "h & j & k\n",

    "f_1a + f_2b + f_3d + f_4e & f_1b + f_2c + f_3e + f_4g \\\\\n",
    "f_1d + f_2e + f_3h + f_4j & f_1e + f_2g + f_3j + f_4k\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Filter matrix is like the weights and biases for a dense NN. It starts with random values for f1,f2,f3,and f4*\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: Line up the filter with the image, multiply all the corresponding pairs and then add up those products. Repeat for all positions of the filter as allowed by [the stride and the padding](https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Part-2/). The relative position of the filter to the image will tell you which entry in the resultant matrix you're filling in.\n",

    "#### Pooling\n",
    "What is pooling? The main goal in inserting a pooling layer is to reduce dimensionality, which helps to reduce both network computation and model overfitting. This is generally a matter of reducing a matrix or tensor of values to  some smaller size, and the most common way of doing this is by partitioning the large matrix into $n$ x $n$ blocks and then replacing each with the largest value in the block. Hence we speak of \"MaxPooling\".\n",
